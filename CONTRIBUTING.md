# Contributing :blue_heart:

Thanks for thinking about helping with AngularDart!
Here are a couple of ways that you can contribute:

* [Migrate](MIGRATION.md) the docs to the latest version! 
* [Report issues](https://github.com/angulardart-community/site-angulardart/issues/new).
* Fix issues (especially ones with the label
  **[help wanted](https://github.com/angulardart-community/site-angulardart/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen%20is%3Aissue%20label%3A%22help%20wanted%22%20)**).
  * Right now, it's recommended to solve every open issue from the original repo one by one. When you want to work on one, create a new issue at this repo with the same title and description, and add "Copied from dart-lang/site-angulardart#(issue number)" to the end with some additional comments, if any. For example, "Copied from dart-lang/site-angulardart#169"
  * If this is your first contribution—_welcome!_—check out issues that are 
  labeled **[beginner](https://github.com/angulardart-community/site-angulardart/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3A%22help%20wanted%22%20label%3Abeginner%20)**.
  Beginner issues may or may not be easy to fix.
  Sometimes they're issues we don't have the expertise to fix ourselves,
  and we'd love to work with a contributor who has the right skills.
  * We use the usual [GitHub pull
    request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) process.
  * We follow the [Google Developer Documentation Style
    Guide](https://developers.google.com/style/).
* Submitting a pull request
  * Every pull request **must** has a corresponding issue! If yours does not, create one and say something like "I'm working on it" at the end so that other people won't be wasting time. If you don't know how to reference an issue, see the [Github docs](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/autolinked-references-and-urls#issues-and-pull-requests).
* Automating workflows
  * We're gradually migrating the workflow utility from `gulpjs` to Dart's `grinder`. It's recommended to understand JS for this situation. The files are in the [tool](tool/grind.dart). Due to the nature of this project, it's better for a single person to work on it rather than multiple people contributing together, since different people can write drastically different code where only the person who wrote it can understand. If you really want to, please **COMMENT YOUR CODE**.

To avoid wasting your time, talk with us before you make any nontrivial
pull request. The [issue tracker](https://github.com/angulardart-community/site-angulardart/issues)
is a good way to track your progress publicly, but we can also communicate
other ways such as [email](mailto:gavinzhaojw@protonmail.com) and [Gitter](https://gitter.im/dart-lang/home).
